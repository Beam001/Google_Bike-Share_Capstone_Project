# Google_Bike-Share_Capstone_Project
This is the hands on, realistic analysis carried out on a fictional company to establish trends and patterns. This was at the request of Cousera and Google

Tasked to analyze 12 months data of bike trips to find out the differences between casual riders and members
I used different tools; Excel, R and Tableau to solve this task
The detailed process is in the rmd file. 
I have also attached a Presentation, The Tableau Viz image and a link to the dynamic, interactive dashboard
